# 1. Hardcoded credentials and printing sensitive data
def connect_to_db():
    username = "root"  # Hardcoded credentials
    password = "12345"  # Hardcoded password
    print(f"Connecting to database with username: {username} and password: {password}")  # Exposing credentials

# 2. SQL Injection vulnerability and concatenation of user input

    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '" + user_input + "';"  # Vulnerable to SQL Injection

        print(f"{key}: {value}")

# 6. Unused imports and inefficient code
